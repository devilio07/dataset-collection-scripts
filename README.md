# Some of my personal Data collection scripts for Computer Vision with DL

For training any Deep Learning model an architrcture is indeed important.But what holds the equal necessity is the Data you're going to train upon.

Recently I was working upon ResNe50 a deep 50 layer Residual Network for learning hand gestures.
Now since I didn't want to grab images from the internet, I decided to collect my own.

So I just decided to create my own Python Script and OpenCV to collect some data.

dataset_collection_gestures.py is an fully automated data collection script. Just make sure you've a working Web-Cam.
